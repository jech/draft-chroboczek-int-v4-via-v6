1.  Introduction

   The role of a routing protocol is to build a routing table, a data
   structure that maps network prefixes in a given family (IPv4 or IPv6)
   to next hops, pairs of an outgoing interface and a neighbor's network
   address, for example:

       destination                      next hop
     2001:db8:0:1::/64               eth0, fe80::1234:5678
     203.0.113.0/24                  eth0, 192.0.2.1

   When a packet is routed according to a given routing table entry, the
   forwarding plane typically uses a neighbor discovery protocol (the
   Neighbor Discovery protocol (ND) [rfc4861] in the case of IPv6, the
   Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) [rfc0826] in the case of IPv4) to
   map the next-hop address to a link-layer address (a "MAC address"),
   which is then used to construct the link-layer frames that
   encapsulate forwarded packets.

   It is apparent from the description above that there is no
   fundamental reason why the destination prefix and the next-hop
   address should be in the same address family: there is nothing
   preventing an IPv6 packet from being routed through a next hop with
   an IPv4 address (in which case the next hop's MAC address will be
   obtained using ARP), or, conversely, an IPv4 packet from being routed
   through a next hop with an IPv6 address.  (In fact, it is even
   possible to store link-layer addresses directly in the next-hop entry
   of the routing table, which is commonly done in networks using the
   OSI protocol suite).

   The case of routing IPv4 packets through an IPv6 next hop is
   particularly interesting, since it makes it possible to build
   networks that have no IPv4 addresses except at the edges and still
   provide IPv4 connectivity to edge hosts.  In addition, since an IPv6
   next hop can use a link-local address that is autonomously
   configured, the use of such routes enables a mode of operation where
   the network core has no statically assigned IP addresses of either
   family, which significantly reduces the amount of manual
   configuration required.  (See also [rfc7404] for a discussion of the
   issues involved with such an approach.)

   We call a route towards an IPv4 prefix that uses an IPv6 next hop a
   "v4-via-v6" route.

   This document discusses the protocol design and operations
   implications of such routes and is designed to be used as a reference
   for future documents.

   { Editor note, to be removed before publication.  This document is
   heavily based on draft-ietf-babel-v4viav6.  When draft-ietf-babel-
   v4viav6 was going through IESG eval, Warren raised concerns that
   something this fundamental deserved to be documented in a separate,
   standalone document, so that it can be more fully discussed, and,
   more importantly, referenced cleanly in the future. }

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Operational Considerations

   The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv4, or simply ICMP)
   [rfc0792] is a protocol related to IPv4 that is primarily used to
   carry diagnostic and debugging information.  ICMPv4 packets may be
   originated by end hosts (e.g., the "destination unreachable, port
   unreachable" ICMPv4 packet), but they may also be originated by
   intermediate routers (e.g., most other kinds of "destination
   unreachable" packets).

   Some protocols deployed in the Internet rely on ICMPv4 packets sent
   by intermediate routers.  Most notably, path MTU Discovery (PMTUd)
   [rfc1191] is an algorithm executed by end hosts to discover the
   maximum packet size that a route is able to carry.  While there exist
   variants of PMTUd that are purely end-to-end [rfc4821], the variant
   most commonly deployed in the Internet has a hard dependency on
   ICMPv4 packets originated by intermediate routers: if intermediate
   routers are unable to send ICMPv4 packets, PMTUd may lead to
   persistent black-holing of IPv4 traffic.

   Due to this kind of dependency, every router that is able to forward
   IPv4 traffic SHOULD be able originate ICMPv4 traffic.  Since the
   extension described in this document enables routers to forward IPv4
   traffic received over an interface that has not been assigned an IPv4
   address, a router implementing this extension MUST be able to
   originate ICMPv4 packets even when the outgoing interface has not
   been assigned an IPv4 address.

   In such a situation, if the router has an interface that has been
   assigned an IPv4 address (other than the loopback address), or if an
   IPv4 address has been assigned to the router itself (to the "loopback
   interface"), then that IPv4 address may be used as the source of
   originated ICMPv4 packets.  If no IPv4 address is available, the
   router could use the experimental mechanism described in Requirement
   R-22 of Section 4.8 [rfc7600], which consists of using the dummy
   address 192.0.0.8 as the source address of originated ICMPv4 packets.
   Note however that using the same address on multiple routers may
   hamper debugging and fault isolation, e.g., when using the
   "traceroute" utility.

   {Editor note: It would be surprising to many operators to see
   something like:

   > $ traceroute -n 8.8.8.8
   traceroute to 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets
    1  192.168.0.1  1.894 ms  1.953 ms  1.463 ms
    2  192.0.0.8  9.012 ms  8.852 ms  12.211 ms
    3  192.0.0.8  8.445 ms  9.426 ms  9.781 ms
    4  192.0.0.8  9.984 ms  10.282 ms  10.763 ms
    5  192.0.0.8  13.994 ms  13.031 ms  12.948 ms
    6  192.0.0.8  27.502 ms  26.895 ms
    7  8.8.8.8  26.509 ms

   Is this a problem though?  If this becomes common practice, will
   operators just come to understand that the repeated 192.0.0.8 is not
   actually a looping packet, but rather that the packet is (probably!)
   making forward progress?  What if it goes: 192.168.0.1 -> 192.0.0.8
   -> 10.10.10.10 -> 192.0.0.8 -> 172.16.14.2 -> dest? }

   { Editor note / question: 192.0.0.8 is assigned in the
   [IANA-IPV4-REGISTRY] as the "IPv4 dummy address".  It may be used as
   a Source Address, and was requested in [rfc7600] to be used as the
   IPv4 source address when synthesizing an ICMPv4 packet to mirror an
   ICMPv6 error message.  This is all fine and good - but, 192.0.0.0/24
   is commonly considered a bogon or martian

   Example (from a Juniper router):

   wkumari@rtr2.pao> show route martians

   inet.0:
                0.0.0.0/0 exact -- allowed
                0.0.0.0/8 orlonger -- disallowed
                127.0.0.0/8 orlonger -- disallowed
                192.0.0.0/24 orlonger -- disallowed
                240.0.0.0/4 orlonger -- disallowed
                224.0.0.0/4 exact -- disallowed
                224.0.0.0/24 exact -- disallowed

   This means that these packets are likely to be filtered in many
   places, and so ICMP packets with this source address are likely to be
   dropped.  Is this a major issue?  Would requesting another address be
   a better solution?  Would it help?  If it were to be allocated from
   some more global pool, it would still likely require "magic" to allow
   it to pass BCP38 filters. }
